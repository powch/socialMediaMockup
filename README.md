# socialmediamockup
A mock social media feed similar to a twitter timeline made with React and Redux.

# Technology Used
* React - control local state and render items based on the Redux store.
* Redux - control application state (display names, messages, timestamps, likes, and dislikes)
* Bootstrap4 via reactstrap components for most of the heavy lifting on the layout and styling. 
* Moment.js - easily formatting date/time and timestamping posts.

# Challenges
Before this project, I was still unsure about how to effectively implement some of Redux's systems, specifically reducers and how they work with actions. With some research, I gained a better understanding of their practical applications and feel more comfortable using Redux in general.
